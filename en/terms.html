                 <p>If a monster spawns and you suffer a disadvantage, the moderator will investigate and you can request compensation from the landowner.</p>

                     <li>Injuries caused by player being attacked, <var>10</var></li>

                 <h4>Formula</h4>
                 <p>YS$(<var>Ground area of normal blocks whose brightness is less than 1 among the target land</var> × <var>Multiplier of compensation amount for target disadvantage</var>)</p >
                 <h4>Condition</h4>
                 <ul>
                     <li>The ground area of regular blocks with brightness less than 1 can be determined during the darkest time.</li>
                     <li>Continuous attacks are treated as one attack.</li>
                     <li>If you are injured by an attack and subsequently die, only lethality can be applied.</li>
                     <li>If there are multiple levels, the ground area can be counted for each level.</li>
                     <li>If there are multiple target disadvantages, multiply by adding each multiplier itself.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h4>Example</h4>
                 <p>Out of the 81 blocks of land <sup>3</sup>, the ground of 98 blocks <sup>3</sup> is a normal block with a brightness of less than 1, and monsters spawned from it was attacked twice and a pet wolf was killed.</p>
                 <p>YS$(<var>98</var> × (<var>10</var> + <var>8</var>) = 1764)</p>
                 <p>So in this case, you can claim YS$1764.</p>
