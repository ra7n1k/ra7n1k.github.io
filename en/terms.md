- When constructing a building, build it in a place where the ground is at least 1 square between the road and 3 squares from other buildings
- The approximate amount of land available for a single building is determined by the distance from the spawn point.
(If you exceed the guidelines, please submit your plan to the *support/general-building-support* channel on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EWfrwBFspF) server)

#### Less than 128 blocks from spawn
