## Code of Conduct (Part of Terms)
This applies to Minecraft servers.

### Items
- Whenever harvesting or *slaughtering* occurs on public farms, plantations, or ranches, an equal or larger number of animals must be propagated or planted with seeds or saplings.
- Collecting and mining resources must be done in the resource world (world name: *resources*) **(Do not do it in the living world)**
- Avoid creating client-intensive structures [^4] **as much as possible** around spawns in worlds that are accessible to all players.
- Allows the use of X-Ray[^5] and mass destruction mods[^6], but some ores and some items other than Admin Shop[^7] ([items banned transactions](/en/items-banned-transactions))
- Transactions are allowed up to 5 YSD above or below [items transaction price](/en/items-transaction-price)

### Land and structures
- The Nether (world name: *world_nether*) is intended only for gathering resources and is not obligated to protect architecture unless specifically indicated by the managers.
- Moderators have the authority to enter any area, and if there is a building that violates the standards, they can remove it after notifying them.
- When constructing a building, make sure to build it in a place where the ground is 1 square with the road and 3 squares or more free with other buildings.
- The approximate land area available for one building is determined by the distance from the spawn point.
(If you exceed the guidelines, please submit your plan to the *support/general-building-support* channel on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EWfrwBFspF) server)

#### 128 blocks or less from spawn point
Ground spacing is at least 1 block, avoid contact, maximum land area is 21 x 29 blocks

#### 512 blocks or less from spawn point
Ground spacing is 3 blocks or more, avoid contact, maximum land area is 29 x 37 blocks

#### 1024 blocks or less from spawn point
Ground spacing is 3 blocks or more, avoid contact, maximum land area is 37 x 45 blocks

#### 1025 blocks or more from spawn point
Avoid contact, no restrictions on land area

If the moderator determines that it is interfering with the use of others, it may be braked after notification.

### Railways and roads
- If you want to construct a railway line (including extension) outside your own property, please send a message to the *support/infrastructural-support* channel on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EWfrwBFspF) server about the width of the railway line. 1 chunk (32 x 32 blocks) Submit approval data from 70% or more (more than half in the case of subway) of residents along the line and route plan, and construct/operate as per the plan.
- Private use and ownership are prohibited, so be sure to design and operate so that it can be used as a public route.
- Structures can be managed by managers/moderators
All associated structures are subject to change in design and withdrawal of planning permission once approved for any reason set out in the Terms and Conditions.

### Monster Traps
- When creating a monster trap, be sure to design and operate it so that it can be used as a public facility. Also, it must be designed so that it can be switched between *operating/non-operating*.
- If you wish to build/renovate, please be sure to submit your plans to the *support/monster-trap* channel on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/EWfrwBFspF) server, and build/operate accordingly.
- If you have a public monster trap of the same type as what you need, use the existing one instead of building new one whenever possible.
- Structures can be managed by moderators
All associated structures are subject to change in design and withdrawal of planning permission once approved for any reason set out in the Terms and Conditions.
